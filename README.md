discord bot to embed twitter links

Currently, when users share a tweet (x) link on Discord, it appears as text instead of being embedded as it used to. However, you can still embed tweets on Discord by adding prefixes to the link. I've created a bot that detects when someone shares an unprefixed x link to a tweet, and the bot responds with the embedded link.
